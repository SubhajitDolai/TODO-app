# Flutter To-Do App

A simple and intuitive to-do app built with Flutter. This app allows users to create, delete, and manage tasks efficiently. Tasks can be checked or unchecked to mark their completion status. The app uses the Hive database for local storage, ensuring fast and reliable performance.

## Features

- **Create Tasks**: Add new tasks easily with a clean and minimalistic interface.
- **Swipe to Delete**: Quickly remove tasks by swiping them to the side.
- **Check/Uncheck Tasks**: Mark tasks as completed or pending with a simple checkbox.
- **Persistent Storage**: All tasks are stored locally using the Hive database, ensuring your tasks are saved even after closing the app.

## Dependencies

- [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) - A framework for building beautiful, natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase.
- [Hive](https://pub.dev/packages/hive) - A lightweight and blazing-fast key-value database written in pure Dart.

## How It Works

The app is built using Flutter's state management features and relies on Hive for storing tasks. Each task is stored as an object in Hive, which ensures that the app is fast and responsive. Users can create, delete, check/uncheck tasks, and even swipe to delete tasks with ease.
